### Non-declarative things (I have not found the correct nix option for these yet) ###

In Gimp you have to manually go to Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Theme
and select the system theme (which was set declaratively, so it's available and correct) instead of the default

In Audacity you have to manually go to Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Theme
and select dark (the system theme affects some parts, but not all)

In Gnome-secrets you may have to manually change the sorting behavior

In Firefox the default zoom level needs to be set manually.
Unwanted search suggestions (history, shortcuts, ...) need to be deactivated under Settings->Search->Address Bar.
