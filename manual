### Non-declarative things (I have not found the correct nix option for these yet) ###

In Gnome-secrets you may have to change the sorting behavior and time to automatic lock.

In KeepassXC you have to select the theme.

In Gimp you have to go to Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Theme and select the system theme (which was set declaratively, so it's available and correct) instead of the default.

In Audacity you have to go to Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Theme and select dark (the system theme affects some parts, but not all).

In Firefox the default zoom level needs to be set manually. Unwanted search suggestions (history, shortcuts, ...) need to be deactivated under Settings->Search->Address Bar.

In Thunderbird adjust the Layout to wide and the view to table view.
