### Setup ###

Install NixOS. Then clone .mynixos to

    $HOME/.mynixos (this is important)

and navigate into it.

Adjust `.mynixos/hosts/filesystems.nix` (this file handles declarative mounting of additional disks and is custom to my disk setup).

Upon installing NixOS a file `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix` was automatically created.
It handles the specifics of your hardware.
Overwrite `.mynixos/hosts/hardware-configuration.nix` with this file.
Now you are ready to apply my configuration, see the steps below. 



### Basics ###

Navigate to `.mynixos`.

To update available packages (if so desired):

    nix flake update

To rebuild the system with a new configuration (or updated packages):

    nixos-rebuild switch --flake .

To rebuild the dotfiles in the home directory:

    home-manager switch --flake ./home



### Garbage collection ###

To delete old builds:

    sudo nh clean all --keep N

where N is the amount of generations to not delete



### Non declarative things ###

In Gimp you have to manually go to Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Theme
and select the system theme (which was set declaratively, so it's available and correct) instead of the default

In Audacity you have to manually go to Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Theme
and select dark (the system theme affects some parts, but not all)

In Gnome-secrets you may have to manually change the sorting behavior

Firefox bookmarks are entirely manaul at the moment.
